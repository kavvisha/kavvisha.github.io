        <p>With the expansion of modern technology, the lifestyle of people is mostly managed and relied on their computers and mobile phones to an increasing extent. On that premise, File classification is a technique in modern storage systems and
          can be introduced as a hierarchical arrangement of classification levels and it allows files to be stored in the most efficient approach. DocSpace is a product to classify and secure data with the aid of security levels. It analyzes data
          before classifying and are categorized as Text files and Image Files. In addition, appropriate measures are taken to prohibit accessing files in lower security level to another higher security level without proper authorization. The major
          goal is to update from the current security level of the file after each modification to improve accuracy. DocSpace is a single integrated based hybrid data classification system which is developed using High level Microservice architecture
          to prevent intentional or unintentional misbehaviors.</p>

          <p class="lead">Special Features</p>
          <p>DocSpace is a machine learning-based single integrated hybrid data classification system,
            developed to perform text and image classification together, to re-classify the updated classified
            files and to prevent intentional and unintentional miss-behavior on the implemented system. The
            system is developed using High-Level Microservice Architecture therefore it is independently
            deployable. Following the global data standards is one main reason why DocSpace is a
            commercially valuable product. DocSpace is developed not only to classify data but also to
            reclassify them if any changes or modification happens to either the text file or an image file.
            With the novel and smart technologies used in implementing DocSpace over 90% of accuracy is
            achieved. Throughout the design and development phase, a lot of attention was given to reduce
            the resource consumption rate. Therefore, DocSpace is a cost-effective solution for any
            organization. The system is designed with user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive functions
            which are easier to handle without much IT knowledge to obtain the maximum security.
            Role-Based Access Control along with a token-based authentication is used to prevent the
            system and its data to maintain high-level authentication. This system has categorized the files
            into three classification levels namely Secret, Confidential, and private. The higher processing
            speed of DocSpace provides the ability to process the information quickly thus increasing the
            productivity.
