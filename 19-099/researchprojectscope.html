          <br>
          <p>
            Text classification is one of the major segments in a data classification system which is the procedure of organizing the type of text file automatically based on the given dataset. Several text classification concepts are available in
            the research world based on different supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts.

            The threat of leakage of sensitive information from inside attacks can be minimized by using DLP techniques. DLP techniques are composed with several phases as the discovering phase, detecting phase, protecting phase and monitoring phase
            [1].

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Discovery Phase - Unlabeled data is scanned with a scanning agent and is passed to the detecting component for classification [1].</li>
              <li>Detecting Phase - Data is classified and labeled according to the sensitivity level.</li>
              <li>Protecting Phase - Based on the classification, information is either passed to the safe module or transmitted over unsecure paths. The system is developed to provide protection to the data in different approaches as treat
                transmitting data and data at rest [1].</li>
              <li>Monitoring Phase - At last, the monitoring module guarantees naming consistency and tracks clients' activities on the sensitive data inside the system [1].</li>

            Most of the developed classification algorithms are based on machine learning principles. A machine learning text classification system can be broken down into 4 components as text pretreatment, text representation, classifier training
            and
            classification. This classification system is a Chinese news text classifier which is based on K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes and Support vector machine [2].
          </p>

          <p>
            This research paper is based on the above mentioned components and this proposed system is developed to train the classifier module depending on the existing datasets which will classify the unclassified news. The shown Figure II
            illustrates the four components of a text classification system and the basic relationship between them [2].

          <p>
            Social media is one of the most prominent information sharing platforms in the modern world. There are some advantages as well as some disadvantages of using social media. Sharing of the sensitive information in an unauthorized manner is
            one of the major disadvantages of social media. Sex-related information, violate news are some of them. This research paper is based on content classification based on sensitivity level. The proposed system is developed under two stages
            [3].

          <p>
            The solution heavily focuses on two classifiers, general advertisement classifier and sensitivity detector. General advertisement classifier will classify the content based on the text and assign the advertisements to the respective Ad
            class. The sensitivity detector will then classify the pre-classified advertisements again based on the sensitive information to produce results. The hierarchical architecture developed within the system enables the functioning of the
            system efficiently which is shown in the <i>Figure III</i> below [3].

          <p>
            Another method to classify files is based on the image content of the file. Image classification is referred to as a process that is able to classify an image according to its visual content. An image classification algorithm has to be
            designed to analyze the content of the image. David Kaeli, in his book which is heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL 2.0 states how important the BoW model is related to document classification and natural language processing. Furthermore
            he highlights the fact that the BoW model is used to classify images. For this purpose, features of the image should be identified and should be fed for the machine learning algorithm. A feature generation algorithm can be used to convert
            an image to a set of features which is also called as the signature of the image.

            that the two regions of the image are visually different. This process is aided by already available image databases with a number of patterns which leads to machine learning.

          <p>
            No matter how advanced the current technology is, there is still a slow development and
            inventions in the cause of securing data at rest. The monopoly that the high standard
            organizations maintain to keep their social reputation is a major reason for this. They demotivate
            small scale organizations in securing their personal information which will enable them to collect
            data through internal attacks. For example top rated stock broking firms use employees of
            upcoming stock broking companies to collect information about pending bids by paying them.

          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout history various organizations and governments introduced different solutions to
            address the problem of Data Loss. The Enigma machine can be considered as one such solution
            which was able creates a turning point in the field of Cyber Security. But in the recent past,
            traditional countermeasures such as manually controlled inbound storage spaces or file based
            storage systems have proven ineffective against internal attacks causing serious problems. This
            has created a huge loophole in the field of information security making it really difficult for the
            officials to control. Due to the negligence of the authorities, a huge gap is now created making it
            difficult for the security enthusiasts to recover soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand with the development of technology and the rapid increment of the use of the
            internet, security of sensitive information is at a higher risk. Usually these problems are
            addressed through enforcing security measures to the whole system. But modern advanced
            technologies are continuously causing problems to these measures proving them unreliable,
            expensive and resource consuming. Therefore classification of data can be considered as another
            approach designed to protect information other than enforcing security measures on the system
            as a whole. Although the approach is presented and several systems are developed, there is a
            requirement for a single integrated hybrid system which can classify documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations store heaps of information. Controlling, managing and manipulating these
            information is a huge challenge to any organization in the presence of modern technology. Also
            these information should be classified based on the sensitivity level in order to fulfill the security
            requirements of the organization. Although the prevailing solutions are capable of classifying
            information based on few specific purposes, there is no one integrated machine learning module
            to classify organizational documents which are specific to various industry domains.
          </p>
          <p>Moreover due to the fact that modern technologies are rapidly used in most of the organizations
            worldwide, there is a huge gap in the industrial world for technicians who are capable of
            handling latest technology based products. One main example to prove the above point is that
            there should be a specially recruited team to configure the Banking Software everyday which is
            just running the same piece of code in all machines. But there is a possibility to reduce the IT
            support team if the configuration is automated using an understandable user interface which does
            not need any technical knowledge about that.</p>
          <p>It is clear that although there are several attempts carried out in this purpose, a solution which
            can address the above mentioned problems is still in need. Therefore the main focus of this
            research is to develop a solution which will cover all the required aspects and to make DocSpace
            the best among the list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_panel">
          <p class="lead">Research Problem</p>
          <p>
            With the expansion of modern technology, the lifestyle of people is mostly managed and relied
            on their computers and mobile phones to an increasing extent. On that premise, File
            classification can be introduced as a technique to the modern storage systems which can be
            introduced as a hierarchical arrangement of classification levels in an efficient approach to
            address the problem of how to secure information. But the major problem in the industrial world
            is that there is no solution implemented to classify documents using the principle idea of using
            file properties such as date and time the file was created, size of the file, owner and access
            patterns and classifies files.
          </p>
          <p>
            However to address this problem, technological approaches should be analyzed covering the
            main objective. Based on the developed classification structures it was clear that machine
            learning technologies are used to achieve the utmost goal of classifying files in an effective
            manner. But it was required to analyze on how to come up with a solution which can introduce a
            unified methodology to classify and secure data with the aid of security levels which can be
            considered as a valuable solution to the industrial space over many security related issues.
            However, the requirement of analyzing data before classifying in order to get a clear
            understanding about the data that is about to be classified should be looked after to obtain the
            maximum output. Although several organizations have implemented different standards and
            policies, lack of understanding of the general public on this matter is still acting as a barrier
            making it difficult to step up as a community. Moreover, it is required to find out how to
            implement appropriate measures to prohibit accessing files in lower security levels to higher
            security levels without proper authorization. This will enable the small scale organizations to
            keep their sensitive information private and also to come up with innovative solutions which will
            make them unique and successful. Although governments are still not keen on paying some
            attention to address this issue as a nation, the impact made by intruders and attackers on
            governing bodies is still at a very high level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations are experiencing serious problems due to the Higher Cost and Higher Resource
            Consumption Rate when Implementing Data Prevention Techniques. As discussed in the
            previous section this is one of the main reasons why organizations are neglecting the security of
            their data. Further Most of existing systems require Expert Knowledge to achieve Maximum
            Performance. Therefore it is needed to wait for a technical support officer to make the required
            changes in order to proceed with the work in any kind of minor uncleariblity. Based on the above
            details it is clear that a solution with lower resource consumption and lower implementation cost
            is required. Further the system should be able to address the problem of complex operational
            knowledge. There is no evidence to prove the existence of a Single Integrated Solution that can
            classify industrial specific files based on the level of sensitivity of the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important requirement in developing security solutions is the control of the access
            aspect of the system. The particular solution won’t be even to clothe term security if the proper
            access controls are not there. At the present time, the security solutions which are using access
            control mechanisms couples with authentication mechanisms which are obsolete and which are
            highly prone to attacks. Therefore, there is a clear line between the use of the proper access
            control mechanisms along with industry standard authentication protocol to secure the resources
            which need to be protected and the securing of users which are using the security solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a major problem in the process of updating from the current security level of the
            file after each modification to improve accuracy. This can be considered as a problem based on
            securing the classified files which are stored. Comparatively there is a lack of focus on securing
            the classified files in both traditional classification methods and latest classification methods.
            Therefore it is required to find out how to keep the files continuously safe. This proposed model
            is based on the question how to develop a single integrated based hybrid data classification
            system using high level Microservice architecture to prevent intentional or unintentional
            misbehaviors.

          <p>
            Almost all the activities of the world have some sort of digital intervention to it. Let it be simply
            reserving a book from a library to voting. All these services or products take the advantage of
            digital devices and systems to speed up the process or to have an effective and efficient outcome.
            Digital devices and systems use data as a main input. Therefore, it is crucial that the data which
            is fed into these systems are kept and handled in a secure and organized manner. Data
            classification is meant to set labels and categories for data based on the sensitivity of data.</p>

          <p>In the recent past, traditional countermeasures have proven inefficient when dealing with inside
            attacks. Classification of data is one of the most prominent and modern security measures
            followed by organizations in order to obtain DLP from insider attacks. With the rapid
            enhancement of the technology and the continuous nature of the information collection process
            an efficient system to classify data is required. After analyzing the aspects of the research
            problems, a set of specified objectives were constructed to design a new product covering all the
            identified gaps.</p>

          <p><b>Main Objective</b></p>

          <p>The main objective of this research is to develop machine learning based single integrated hybrid
            data classification solution to perform text and image classification together, to re-classify the
            updated classified files and to prevent intentional or unintentional miss behavior using the
            classification implemented. Further the specification of the solution to the industrial world which
            the prevailing solutions are not capable of was also focused throughout the process. In addition
            to the main objective several specific objectives were designed to increase the productivity and
            efficiency of the product while maintaining the commercial quality. The total product which
            includes 4 major components is designed completely based on this objective scope.</p>


          <p><b>Specific Objectives</b></p>

          <p>The main focus of this section is on the secondary objectives that can be either specific or
            different to each component related to the product. Although they are described under the
            secondary objectives section, it is really important to keep in mind that these conditions should
            also function accordingly in order for the complete system to run. Also to ensure that the
            assumptions made during the project development period.</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collection of text and image documents based on the relevant industry domain to train
                the classifier.</li>
              <li>Categorization of the documents into different classification levels based on the global
                data standards.</li>
              <li>Selection and implementation of supervised machine learning techniques for
                classification.</li>
              <li>Implementation of OCR based image to text conversion algorithm.</li>
              <li>Implementation of token based authentication mechanism.</li>
              <li>Development of security levels and user roles based on role based access control
                mechanisms.
              </li>
              <li>Maintenance of the continuous classification process through Hashing.</li>
              <li>Maintaining the functional independence of the components to make sure that the final
                product can be switched based on the industry audience.</li>
              <li>Implementation of a user-friendly environment to allow the users to operate the system
                with minimum knowledge to gain maximum performance.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the designed components will not make any difference to the cost estimation
                of the final product. </li>
              <li>Development of the components to function based on minimum resources consumption
                but maximum efficiency.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the solution is easily accessible and portable while maintaining the security.</li>
              <li>Adoption of a commercially valuable development structure and a sustainable outcome.</li>
            </ul>

          <p class="lead">Audience</p>
          <p>The factors that are explained in the previous sections prove that one of the major reasons for not
            using classification as a security implementation to secure data is the lack of focus on developing
            a solution that is fixed to a wider range of users. As an example the second solution explained
            under literature survey is based on Chinese news classification which is useful only to a minor
            social sector. Therefore this research is developed with the objective of expanding the audience
            to motivate the organizations to use these types of solutions.</p>
          <p>Therefore DocSpace is designed based on a complex mechanism which is advanced enough to be
            used in any industry domain where data classification is required. It can vary from industries
            which require lower level security implementations such as Education, Agriculture and
            Transportation to industries which require higher level security implementations such as
            Military, Banking and Finance. However the dataset which is to be used should be changed and
            tweaked based on the industry that the product will be used. For the development purpose we
            have trained the model based on the Banking and Finance industry which is one area where a
            solution similar to this is essential.</p>
