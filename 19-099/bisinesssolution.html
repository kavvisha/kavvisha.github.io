          <p>
            In the recent past, traditional countermeasures such as manually controlled inbound storage spaces or file-based storage systems have proven ineffective against internal attacks. Data classification is one of the most important and modern
            security measures followed by organizations to obtain DLP against internal attacks. With the rapid improvement of technology and the continuous nature of the information gathering process, an effective data classification system is
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most existing systems are based on text or image files, and most systems require expert knowledge to achieve maximum performance. In addition, organizations are experiencing serious problems due to the higher cost and consumption of
            resources in data prevention techniques. DocSpace is a single integrated system of adaptive classification of data that can classify text files and image files according to the level of sensitivity of the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product is designed and developed under four main components which are functionally independent from each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Text classification</li>
              <li>Image classification </li>
              <li>Prevention techniques</li>
              <li>File modification detection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The files will be classified using machine learning technologies based on their levels of significance with regard to the predefined parameters such as sensitivity depending on specifications such as Health Insurance Portability and
            Accountability Act, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and General Data Protection Regulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The high level architecture of DocSpace includes a common database and a front end application which leads to micoservice architecture. The front end application is developed using angular. Python is used to implement text classification,
            image to text conversion and the hashing mechanism under one service structure. Node is used to implement the file upload function and user management function under the other service structure. The whole system is connected to a common
            database. The integrated system allows the users to upload files using the Angular implementation
          </p>
          <p>
            DocSpace is designed based on a complex mechanism which is advanced enough to be used in any industry domain where data classification is required. It can vary from industries which require lower level security implementations such as
            Education, Agriculture and Transportation to industries which require higher level security implementations such as Military, Banking and Finance. However the dataset which is to be used should be changed and tweaked based on the industry
            that the product will be used. For the development purpose we have trained the model based on the Banking and Finance industry which is one area where a solution similar to this is essential
          </p>
          <p>
            The target user audiences of DocSpace can vary from small-scale organizations upto multi national large-scale companies that are handling confidential data regularly. Moreover one main objective of developing this product is to demotivate
            the employees who are engaged in internal data thefts for pay. It is believed that this solution will eventually motivate the industry experts to focus more on securing their organisational information while ensuring the trust and the
            convenience of the employees. This was the major reason to focus on innovation and commercialization equally during the development phase. As future work, the complete product can be modified as an online tool for the users to register
            and store the files based on the sensitivity and it would be significant if the system is implemented as a cloud-hosted software with an encryption channel per security level.

          <p class="lead">Why DocSpace?</p>
          <p>
            DocSpace is designed and implemented based on the four main components. The components are independent from each other in a functional level leading to several advantages. The most specific advantage can be considered as Model Switching
            which is the ability to train the same model with an aid of a different dataset of the same type under a brief amount of time depending on the related audience and most importantly without affecting other components. This can be
            highlighted as one of the biggest loopholes in the prevailing solutions. With a feature like Model Switching, the value of the product can be raised quality wise and as well as commercially.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover the fact that the product compliant with global data standards such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPPA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCIDSS) and General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)
            is another advantage for the product to have a significant commercial value
          </p>
          <p>
            Since DocSpace is implemented as a web hosted software, it is convenient for the users to work from any remote location. For the users who do not have enough technical knowledge, it is easy to work with the product because of the user
            adaptive system design and the user friendly interfaces. This product is designed considering the modern industrial trends such as work from home and bring your own device (BYOD) adding more value to the product
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless the most remarkable feature of the product is that this system can be modified and hosted as an online service which is able to function as a cloud storage that classifies files before storing This can be implemented as a paid
            service with several packages depending on the number of security levels and the storage space.

          <p class="lead">Features</p>
          <p>
            DocSpace is a machine learning-based single integrated hybrid data classification system which
            is developed to perform text and image classification together, to re-classify the updated
            classified files and to prevent intentional and unintentional miss-behavior on the implemented
            system. The system is developed using High-Level Microservice Architecture therefore it is
            independently deployable. Following the global data standards is one main reason why
            DocSpace is a commercially valuable product. DocSpace is developed not only to classify data
            but also reclassify them if any changes or modification happens to either the text file or an
            image file. With the novel and smart technologies used in implementing DocSpace over 90% of
            accuracy is achieved. Throughout the design and development phase a lot of attention was
            given to reduce the resource consumption rate. Therefore, DocSpace is a cost-effective solution
            for any organization. The system is designed with user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive
            functions which are easier to handle without much IT knowledge to obtain the maximum
            security. Role-Based Access Control along with a token-based authentication is used to prevent
            the system and its data to maintain high-level authentication. This system has categorized the
            files into three classification levels namely Secret, Confidential, and private. The higher
            processing speed of DocSpace provides the ability to process the information quickly and
            without doing it consciously.

          <p>
            <b>Schools</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Schools contain almost all the data that a student will ever have. The Full Name, Address, Parents Names, Addresses and their Contact number, Email addresses. The School database will have all the information regarding the student and the
            family. This importance of data protection in schools is a forgotten fact. But it is important to secure the data in schools as well since it provides a whole package of data just up for grabs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Financial Institutions</b>
          </p>
          <p>It is out of debate that the Financial Institutions need to have the data classified. Financial Institutions are dealing with the hard-earned money of the general public and they are even charging for that purpose. Therefore, it is a
            high responsibility of them and as well adherence to standard best practices to implement a data classification scheme. PCI DSS & GDPR instruct all Financial Institutions to utilize a data classification scheme to protect data.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Healthcare Organizations</b>
          </p>
          <p>There are vast amount of data circulating inside the healthcare organizations. There’s payment card information, personal identifiable information and data related to the health of individuals. These data should be confidential and there
            integrity should be ensured as well. Since all those other times its affecting the finances or the privacy, but here it can directly affect the health of the person. Even HIPAA emphasizes the need to implement a Data Classification
            Solution.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Military Organizations</b>
          </p>
          <p>Data classification itself has its origins from the Military Sector. Military organizations contain information which are crucial for a country’s and eventually the entire world’s security. Military organizations are places where the
            classification of information is highly in practice. Therefore, to ease their work and provide further security to information, data classification solution is the ideal solution.</p>
