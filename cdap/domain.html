          <p>
            Drowning generally happens mutely, with solely a number of folks ready to wave their hands or call for help. To understand why it's therefore necessary to place confidence in safety once in or around the water, one would like solely look into drowning statistics. In 2015, Associate an estimated 360 000 people died from drowning, creating drowning a serious public unhealthiest worldwide. Drowning accounts for 75% of deaths overflowing disasters. Flood disasters are getting additional frequent and this trend is predicted to continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once somebody starts to drown, the end result is often fatal. not like different injuries, survival
            is determined virtually completely at the scene of the incident but there are many actions to prevent drowning and as well as the flooding. In here we are introducing a product which can help to survive from drowning and flooding.

            We first reviewed the information in the 2013 iSwimband. This has been developed by Paul Chu.This is a waterproof device is known as the iSwimband. It sits around the head of a child and has a Bluetooth-enabled sensor at the front. When the device detects the kid has fallen into water, it sends associate in nursing alert right away to the parent so that they will come back and rescue them. For the interactive features, such as sensor is paired with a compatible Bluetooth-enabled smart device running the free iSwimband app. It has a battery life of hundreds of hours of active monitoring . Include features in our proposed product such as Estimating the depth of water using Sonar Signals and Gyro and Accelerometer Sensors, Underwater Communication Modem using a Sonar Signals, Flood Detection and Floating Device to collect data transmitted from Wearable and Send data to server which is mobile app is connected, Collect pulse rate of the user and water level and water flow from sensors and predict User condition and Potential Flood using Machine Learning algorithm.
            In 2015 a design of Low-Power Acoustic Modem for underwater communication has been developed by Jagdale M.R.1,Puranik V.G  . This has been developed mainly by focusing on networks frequently depend upon acoustic communication, which poses some of demanding situations for reliable data transmission. Mainly has several interactive features such as to transmitted Signals in the Ultrasonic Transmitter and received Signals in the Ultrasonic receiver, transforms mechanism for analogue signals into digital signals, software sampling method to interpret signals as the original signals, frequency generators ,ampliﬁers ,ultrasonic sensors and many methods with sensors have been used in this project. In 2015 another Acoustic Modem for underwater communication has been produced by Slamet Indriyanto, Ian Yosef Matheus Edward  .This research was based on underwater acoustic modem with ultrasonic frequency using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) Modulation. The designed system consist of FSK modem, microcontroller, amplifier and transducer. Waterproof ultrasonic sensors JSN-SR04T are used as transducers for designed modems. Some of the features are included in our proposed product as well. As well, another an ultra-Low Power and flexible Acoustic Modem design to develop energy-efficient underwater sensor networks was developed by Pedro Yuste, Angel Perles and Juan José Serrano in 2012  . This is focused on the description of the physical layer of a new acoustic modem called ITACA. The modem architecture includes as a major novelty an ultra-low power asynchronous wake-up system implementation for underwater acoustic transmission that is based on a low-cost off-the-shelf RFID peripheral integrated circuit.

            SYN Flood Detection Algorithms has been produced by Matt Beaumont-Gay  . He implemented three SYN flood detection algorithms such as SynFinDiff, SynRate, and PCF.SynFinDiff has good detection speed but takes a very long time to return to a non-alert state. SynRate is significantly and negatively affected by attacks that create high variance in the traffic rate, but is faster than SynFinDiff at signaling the end of an attack and PCF performs very well with regards to both detection time and quiescence time. In our proposed product, developing flood detection algorithm by using some of features. Advance Flood Detection and Notification System based on Sensor Technology and Machine Learning Algorithm was developed by Mohammed Khalaf, Abir Jaafar Hussain, Dhiya Al-Jumeily in 2014  . This basically flood detection system designed for immediate notification to the native authorities. It determined the present water level victimisation sensing element network, that provides notification via SMS and internet base public network through GSM electronic equipment. SMS and internet base public network area unit valuable alert communication tools which will distribute the knowledge to the floods victims among specific space. Four machine-learning algorithms were utilized to classify flood knowledge. For our project we applied some of the features such as GSM module, PS module to track the location etc.

            Speed of the sound is determined by the by a combination of the mediums rigidity and its density, the more rigid the medium faster the speed of the sound, the speed of the sound in air is low because air is compressible, and because liquids and solids are very rigid it is very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such area are generally greater than in gases.
            In our proposed product, it'll be hoped to specialise in folks that area unit underneath meditation separately. Therefore, the small print that were gathered through this analysis paper can be rather more useful to the progress of our analysis.

          <p>
            Currently created systems are implemented for swimming pools rather than rivers lakes and beaches. Laser light, LDR and water pressure sensors are mounted in top of the walls of the pool. The application is not wearable.
            Then another research has been done to implement an inflatable wrist band system SNS College of Technology Coimbatore, India. Which triggers to open a small air bag when the user is drowning . In here only the person wearing the wrist band knows that he/she is drowning .
            Another product “i swim band” was launched in 2013 to prevent drowning of children in swimming pools. This has been developed by Paul Chu .This is a waterproof device is known as the iSwimband. It sits around the head of a child and has a Bluetoothenabled sensor at the front. When the device detects the kid has fallen into water, it sends associate in nursing alert right away to the parent so that they will come back and rescue them. For the interactive features, such as sensor is paired with a compatible Bluetooth-enabled smart device running the free iSwimband app. It has a battery life of hundreds of hours of active monitoring .
            In our proposed system the wearable device alerts the life guard to gain his/her attention where wider range of people can be alerted when a user is in danger.
            Smart Guardian wearable device calculates the depth of water and collects the pulse rate of the user. After calculating the depth of the water, user will be alerted if he/she is going to a deeper area through a vibration ins the wearable device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of safety in aquatic environments, the only step which was taken as a wearable device is the iSwimBand . Which only capable of alerting parents if their children is drowning in the home pool.
            But our proposed product, SmartGuardian demands the safety of in aquatic environments like rivers, lakes and oceans where children and elders might know how deep they are going to. So if they cannot swim and if they are reaching towards a deeper area they can take safety precautions before getting drowned.

          <p class="lead">Research Problem</p>
          <p>
            Aquatic Safety is a critical matter that people should consider when they enjoy themselves in aquatic environments mostly like rivers, lakes, runnels and oceans. People are advised to swim in the water where visibly perspective to respective person. Because they can rescue the person if happens any accident for some reason. But we hear daily numerous serious injuries and death occurred due to drowning or other accidents which caused by water. The main reason for drowning in water is unaware of the depth of water and communication disabilities while the person in water. When we comes to communication disability, it can be affects to different ways. As a example if a person confront a critical heart condition while person in the water, person might not be able to summon for help or no one will attentive about the person who ever prepared to rescue them. As well with the age, teenager or children are brash. They are not listening their guardians. Hence, they are lead to their own death.

            Floods are the most widespread natural disaster. “Nobody is strong enough to stand up under a flood”. Therefore, their damage is so extensive. Flood is responsible for lost of thousands of lives, their wealth, and their home. All of them are pour down to the flood. Flood can be occurred due to heavy rains, broken dams, overflowing rivers likewise it develop by naturally or due to manmade mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome this problem, we proposed Smart Guardian as our 4th-year research project that it will be much helpful for all human beings. Through this project, the respective user will be notified about the affected person if the person is in critical condition in the water and notify the user about the flood to entrench themselves before incur to the flood.
          </p>
          <p>
            While doing this, several research problems are identified such as,
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to identify whether related person is in critical condition?</li>
              <li>How to locate the affected person?</li>
              <li>How to identify flood area?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome above issues, several information and details are gathered through so many resources like internet, research papers, articles etc. As well, in the developing process, many numbers of sensors have to be used and we have to develop this project in most feasible manner

                  People are basically unaware about the depth of the water where they are stands. Hence, this could be have a higher probability of drowning. The wearable device is capable of measure the depth of the water. If the user is going through deeper area, it will trigger an alert through vibration of the device. This wearable device is waterproof and it feasible to use any user.
                  Sonar sensor is used to measure the distance from the wearable device and the bottom of the water body (riverbed, ocean floor and lakebed) assume that distance as x.
                  Imagine a triangle as in figure 3, the slant of the triangle will be x. therefore, to find the estimated depth (h) in the front area, we have to use trigonometry.

                <p>
                  Since we acquire the degree of angle and the slant (hypotenuse) using the respective sensors we can estimate the depth of the water (side opposite) according to trigonometry using below formula.

                  The water communication the purpose is to transmit information from under the water to above water because we need to collect allow information under the water.This is something very difficult to implement because even though sound travels well in water, our vocal cords are not designed to generate underwater sound.
                </p>
                <p> Due to the large attenuation and absorption electromagnetic signal does not propagation well in the water. There for we use acoustic signals. Acoustic waves are a type of longitudinal wave that propagate by means of adiabatic compression and decompression. Acoustic waves travel with the speed of sound depends on the medium they are passing through.

                  Acoustic Modem; Basically this responsible for translating bit streams into the form of signals that can be transmitted. This consists of three major components as transmitted signals in the Ultrasonic Transmitter received signals in the Ultrasonic receiver and ultrasonic sensors. Transducer; is a component in-order to translate an electrical signal (sending side) into an acoustic signal and translate back to acoustic signal into electricity (receiving end). Ultrasonic sensor; transmits these amplified signals. 200 kHz transceivers can be used as both transmitter and receiver.

                <p>
                  Floating device is literally act as an intermediary source for the underwater communication and it float top of the water. We implement this device because the server could not able to communicate with the devices, which are in the water. The floating device in comprise with set of sensors for each task. To determine the depth of the water it has a sensor called depth-sensing sonar sensor and to determine the speed of the water flow it has a sensor called water flow sensor. Floating device capture the data, which are receives from the wearable device at the same time sends the all data to the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not the only purpose of this device, which is capable of doing. If someone drowning, we trigger the alert to our mobile application. However, we need to locate the affected person. Therefore keeping track of a person in the underwater is an essential part of this process. To achieve this we follows a process as below that how we tackle this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> A GPS tracker in the floating device so we’ll know the exact location of each floating device.</li>
                    <li> When a user data gets sent to the floating device a timestamp will also be included in the data file</li>
                    <li> After receiving the data file, the timestamp will be converted to local time and compare with the time received and calculate how much time did it take the data to arrive.</li>
                    <li> With this result, we are going to calculate an approximate value and show it in a radius respective to a floating device.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, the floating device has two communication modules to communicate with the wearable device, which is the underwater communication and RF communication to capture the data from the sensors in wearable device to send data to the server.

                  Flood can happen in multitude ways. Most commonly happens when rivers or streams overflow their banks. Excessive rain, a ruptured dam can be caused for this and overwhelm a river and send it spreading over the adjacent land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this component need to detect the flood to notify the user which it will be helpful for them to entrench themselves before incur it. In order to do that as displayed in Figure 13 should collect the set of data that are acquired from sensors in floating device.
                  When comes to the data, water flow rate calculate using data acquired from the water flow sensor. It consist three different type of components. Water rotor rolls when the water flows through it and measure the speed of the water flow. Then half effect sensor output the correspond pulse signal. The ultrasonic sensor using for measure the depth of the water. Sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave reflected back from riverbed/lakebed/ocean floor
                  Depth of the water estimate by the using sonar sensor. It provide us the distance in between floating device and the water floor.
                  By considering all those parameters and input into flood algorithm to determine whether is there any probability to flood at respective area.
                  Location of the floating device track down from the GPS tracker it provide us the location where the floating device is at and we can determine where the flood will occur.
